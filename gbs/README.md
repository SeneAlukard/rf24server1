# gbs

Ground base station sample using a copy of headers from the
`rf24drone` project. It demonstrates handling of join requests,
telemetry packets and command broadcasting using the same folder
layout as the drone library. The code lives in the top level `gbs`
directory with the usual `include/` and `src/` subdirectories.
